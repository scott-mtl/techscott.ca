I build, deploy and maintain websites for small-to-medium sized businesses and provide training for staff or business owners to become self-governed for updates to text, photos or blog posts.

I'm currently working on a handful of personal projects, looking to build tools that satisfy an unmet need in a couple of cases and to simply have fun and explore interesting tech in a couple others.
