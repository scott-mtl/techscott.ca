I design, install and maintain custom audiovisual solutions for residential, commercial and educational applications.

From home theaters and full-home audio to boardrooms and videoconferencing or classrooms and active learning spaces; I can find you the perfect A/V solution.

I am a Crestron Certified Designer, Engineer and Technician and have completed Crestron's introductory programming course. I am also very familiar with AMX, Extron, Kramer and Polycom equipment as well as an array of projectors and audio gear.
