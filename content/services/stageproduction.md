I've been involved in stage productions since 2008 and have spent nearly 5 years fulfilling the roles of Technical Director and Venue Manager for a 400-seat multipurpose theater. I have the skills and experience to make sure your production's technical aspects make an impression and are executed flawlessly. 

My work on-stage began in the world of theater, focused primarily on lighting. With a keen interest in music and a drive to expand my technical knowledge, I developed my skills as a live sound engineer and now spend roughly the same amount of time working on both the sound and the lighting aspects of live performance. Alongside a solid set of ears and an eye for artistic lighting, my background with audiovisual equipment provides a solid basis for incorporating projection into stage productions.
